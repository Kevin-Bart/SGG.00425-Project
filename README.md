# SGG.00425 Project

## Evolution of the Upper Vegetation Limit in the Lötschen Valley, Switzerland, from 1984 to 2025 using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 data.

This repository contains code, data, and notebooks for our SGG.00425 Project, focused on processing and analyzing satellite and measurement data from the SwissDC.

- **data/**: Contains all datasets.
  - `raw/`: Raw measurement data.
  - `processed/`:
    - Processed datasets (NetCDF format). Those files are large and ignored by git so they need to be downloaded separately. See instructions below.
    - Processed data files for altitude bands and points with elevation.
  - `external/`: For any external data sources. Here we have a text file with links to `.xyz` files for elevation data.
- **figures/**: Output figures generated by analysis. Organized into subfolders for altitudes, NDVI, PDFs, and time series.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- **src/**: Source code and utilities.
- **.vscode/**: VS Code workspace settings.

This may change but is a good starting point to know where to find things.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   - If you have Git installed, open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/Kevin-Bart/SGG.00425-Project.git
     cd SGG.00425-Project
     ```
   - If you do not have Git installed:
     - Go to [https://github.com/Kevin-Bart/SGG.00425-Project](https://github.com/Kevin-Bart/SGG.00425-Project).
     - Click the blue **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
     - Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.
     - Open the extracted folder in your terminal or VS Code.

2. **Install dependencies**

   - Make sure you have a working Python environment this should already be set up if you have followed the instructions of the course [SGG.00425: Data and methods for environmental analysis [AS-2025]](https://moodle.unifr.ch/course/view.php?id=299803).

3. **⚠️ Download processed data files ⚠️**

   - Download the processed NetCDF files from [this link](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/SkfZgTfBkXcaGWN) and place them in the `data/processed/` directory.

4. **Explore the notebooks**
   - [notebooks/DMFEA_Project_Prep.ipynb](notebooks/DMFEA_Project_Prep.ipynb) contains data preparation steps.
   - [notebooks/DMFEA_Project_Geo.ipynb](notebooks/DMFEA_Project_Geo.ipynb) contains geospatial analysis, we prepared altitude bands here.
   - [notebooks/DMFEA_Project_Final.ipynb](notebooks/DMFEA_Project_Final.ipynb) contains final analysis and results. This is the main notebook for understanding the project's findings.

## Data

- Raw measurement data: [`data/raw/measurements_SwissDC.csv`](data/raw/measurements_SwissDC.csv), provided in the course.
- Processed datasets: [`data/processed/`](data/processed/)

> **Note:** Large processed data files are ignored by git as specified in [.gitignore](.gitignore).
